# TuneAPI Version Bump Process

This rule outlines the required steps for bumping the version of the tuneapi package, as specified in the [Makefile](mdc:Makefile).

## Required Files to Update

When bumping the version, you MUST update these three files in the following order:

### 1. Update pyproject.toml
- Location: [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)
- Line to modify: `version = "X.X.X"` (around line 3)
- Change the version string to the new version number

### 2. Update docs/conf.py  
- Location: [docs/conf.py](mdc:docs/conf.py)
- Line to modify: `release = "X.X.X"` (around line 16)
- Change the release string to match the new version number

### 3. Update changelog
- Location: [docs/changelog.rst](mdc:docs/changelog.rst)
- Add a new section at the top (after line 9) with:
  ```
  X.X.X
  ------
  
  - [Description of changes made in this version]
  
  ```
- Follow the existing format and style
- Keep the previous version entries below

## Upload Process

After updating all three files, the package can be uploaded to PyPI using:

```bash
make upload_to_pypi
```

This command will:
1. Sync dependencies with `uv sync`
2. Build the package with `uv build`  
3. Upload to PyPI with `twine upload dist/*`
4. Clean up the `dist/` directory

## Important Notes

- **All three files must be updated** - the Makefile comment specifically mentions pyproject.toml and docs/conf.py must be updated before upload
- **Changelog must be updated** - always document what changed in the new version
- **Version numbers must match** - ensure the version is identical in both pyproject.toml and docs/conf.py
- **Follow semantic versioning pattern** - use X.X.X format (e.g., 8.0.25)

## Example Version Bump

For bumping from 8.0.24 to 8.0.25:

1. **pyproject.toml**: `version = "8.0.24"` → `version = "8.0.25"`
2. **docs/conf.py**: `release = "8.0.24"` → `release = "8.0.25"`  
3. **docs/changelog.rst**: Add new section:
   ```
   8.0.25
   ------
   
   - [Describe the changes made]
   
   8.0.24
   ------
   ```
